In C++, a template is a simple but powerful tool. The basic idea is to pass the data type as a parameter, eliminating the need to write the same 
code for multiple data types. A software business, for example, may require sort() for many data kinds. We can construct a single sort() function 
and pass data type as a parameter instead of writing and maintaining numerous codes.To support templates, C++ adds two 
new keywords: 'template' and 'typename.' The keyword 'class' can always be used in place of the second keyword. Templates are expanded during 
the compilation process. This is similar to macros. The compiler, on the other hand, performs type checking prior to template expansion. 
The concept is straightforward: source code only contains one function or class, whereas generated code may have numerous copies of the same 
function or class.
