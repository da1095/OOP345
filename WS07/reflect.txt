The Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of C++ template classes that offer methods and data structures that are often used in 
programming, such as lists, stacks, and arrays.  It is a collection of iterators, algorithms, and container classes. Due to the fact that 
it is a generic library, its parts are parameterized. Working with STL requires some familiarity with template classes. Algorithms, Containers, 
Functions, and Iterators are the four parts of the STL.


Data and objects are stored in containers or container types. There are three container adaptor classes, seven "first-class" standard container 
classes, and just one access to these containers or container adaptors is made possible by seven header files. 

Classes that overload the function call operator are included in the STL. These classes' instances are referred to as function objects or functors. 

Functors permit the operation of the corresponding function that can be modified with the use of passed-in parameters.

Iterators are used to work on a succession of values, as their name suggests. They are the primary aspect of STL that permits generality.
