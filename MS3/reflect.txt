Thus, the current semester is drawing to an end. In contrast to OOP244 and IPC144, OOP345 seems to be more sophisticated. We researched threaded programming and 
object-oriented programming using the C++ language to increase programming productivity. I think I've understood the majority of the content we've studied this 
semester overall. There are, however, always situations that call for more expertise and in-depth understanding.The tasks for the final project are more harder; 
I thought it would be easy to complete milestones 1 and 2. The last achievement, on the other hand, is quite difficult. It's not just because many concepts are combined.
It includes material from all earlier classes as well as polymorphism, one of my weaker areas. I'm still working to understand the ideas behind multiple inheritance, 
multithreading, and smart pointers. My worry is that these ideas will be tested on the exam, and if I don't have practise problems on them (or enough practise problems), 
I won't feel prepared. I also want to say that I'm curious to know how the solution code got the assembly line's first task. Everyone couldn't understand this slight challenge
